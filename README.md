# React Assignment Test Program

This project demonstrates the implementation of a React-based application using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Axios. It showcases two main functionalities: a Fruit Selection Todo List and a dynamic API call with data rearrangement.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Axios** - A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Features

1. **Fruit Select Todo List**  
   - Users can select fruits from a list.
   - After selection, the fruit will be returned to the list after a 5-second delay.

2. **API Call List with Data Rearrangement**  
   - An API request is made to retrieve a list of users.
   - The data is then rearranged by department, grouped by gender, age range, hair color, and addresses.

## How to Install

1. Make sure you have **pnpm** installed. If not, you can install it by running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
